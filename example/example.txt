xptp

Based on::
     • sent (https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)
     • Takahashi

Why?
• PPTX is bloated
• LATEX is bloated
• PDF is bloated

also:
sent is not cross platform and
terminal presentations
don't support images…

@images/xptp_nontransparent.jpg
this text will not be displayed, since the @ at the start of the first line
makes this paragraph an image slide.

easy to use

▸ one slide per paragraph
▸ lines starting with # are ignored
▸ image slide: paragraph containing @FILENAME
▸ empty slide: just use a \ as a paragraph

differences from sent

▸ GUI
▸ Dark mode/light mode
▸ Does not auto exit after the last slide, "EOF" is shown instead


# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation

# multiple empty lines between paragraphs are also ignored


# The following lines should produce
# one empty slide

\#This line as well
⇒ Prepend a backslash to kill behaviour of special characters

Images are handled in the
http://tools.suckless.org/farbfeld/
format internally.

xptp also supports transparent images and special characters.
